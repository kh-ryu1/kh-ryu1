## Roles  
- Instrumentation & Telecom Design Engineer  
- Electrical Commissioning Engineer  
- Electrical Supervisor / Superintendent 

## Scope of Work  
### 1. Design Engineering  
- Designed instrumentation and telecom systems for LNG processing facilities and LNG carriers, ensuring integration with power distribution and control networks.  
- Reviewed vendor drawings and ensured compliance with IEC 61850, and class society requirements.  

### 2. Commissioning  
- Conducted loop checks, insulation resistance tests, and functional testing of LV/MV switchboards, transformers, and emergency power systems.  
- Commissioned High/Low-Duty Compressors (HD/LD), Custody Transfer System (CTS), and Cargo Management Systems (CMS), validating control logic, interlocks, and alarm sequences.

### 3. Quality Supervision  
- Performed on-site quality inspections for electrical and instrumentation installation, ensuring conformity with approved drawings and international standards.  
- Supervised cable laying, termination, and gland installation to maintain Ex equipment compliance (IEC 60079) in hazardous areas.  
- Verified FAT/SAT procedures and punchlist clearance before final acceptance.  
- Coordinated with contractors and vendors to resolve non-conformities and documented quality control records.

## Key Achievements  
- Successfully validated complex LNG carrier control & safety logic, enhancing operational safety and reliability.  
- Improved overall installation quality by enforcing strict inspection protocols, preventing major rework during commissioning.  
- Delivered the project on schedule by proactive resolution of site quality issues.
