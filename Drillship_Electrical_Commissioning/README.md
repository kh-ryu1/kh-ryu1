## 🚢 Ultra-Deepwater Drillship Electrical & ICSS Commissioning

### 📌 Project Overview
Commissioning and system integration for ultra-deepwater drillships designed for high-risk offshore drilling operations.

These vessels operate in hazardous environments and require highly reliable power, automation, and safety systems.

---

### ⚡ Commissioning Scope

#### Power & Propulsion Systems
- HV switchboards and power distribution testing
- Power Management System (PMS) validation
- Thruster and propulsion interface verification

#### Automation & Safety Systems
- ICSS integration and functional testing
- Emergency Shutdown (ESD) verification
- Fire & Gas detection system validation
- Cause & Effect logic testing

#### Driling & Marine Integration
- Interface testing with drilling packages
- Dynamic Positioning (DP) system verification
- Marine control and monitoring systems integration

---

### ⚙️ Standards & Compliance
- MODU & offshore safety regulations
- Class society compliance (ABS & others)
- Hazardous area safety requirements

---

### 🎯 Key Contributions
✅ Ensured safe offshore operational readiness  
✅ Verified mission-critical safety systems  
✅ Supported DP and drilling system reliability  
✅ Enabled compliance with offshore safety regulations  

---

### 🌊 Operational Impact
Delivered reliable and safe electrical and safety system performance for deepwater drilling operations in high-risk offshore environments.
