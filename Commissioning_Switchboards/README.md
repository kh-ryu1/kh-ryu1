### ‚öôÔ∏è Commissioning & FAT for Switchboards  
**Role:** Electric Superintendent / Electric Commissioning Engineer  

**Scope of Work:**  
- **Factory Acceptance Test (FAT):**  
  - Witnessed and verified **functional, insulation resistance, and high-potential (Hi-Pot) tests** for LV/MV switchboards.  
  - Checked **busbar alignment, thermal withstand capability, and protection relay settings** in compliance with **IEC 61439** and class society (ABS, DNV) standards.  
  - Reviewed test procedures and signed off FAT documentation as an authorized inspector.  

- **Site Commissioning & Start-up:**  
  - Conducted **pre-commissioning inspections**, including torque checks, cable termination verification, and CT/PT polarity tests.  
  - Performed **secondary injection tests** for protection relays (ANSI codes **50/51, 50N/51N, 27/59, 87**) and verified tripping & interlocking logic.  
  - Carried out **load transfer, blackout recovery, and emergency generator synchronization tests** to ensure operational reliability.  
  - Coordinated with vendors and shipyard teams to resolve wiring and interlock discrepancies before vessel delivery.  

**Key Achievements:**  
- Reduced commissioning delays by implementing a **standardized inspection checklist**, improving troubleshooting efficiency.  
- Identified and corrected multiple misconfigured protection relay settings during FAT, preventing potential nuisance tripping.  
- Contributed to on-time vessel delivery by ensuring all switchboards passed FAT and commissioning without major non-conformities.
