# ðŸ§­ KOPRI Next Generation Arctic Observation Vessel FEED  

## Project Overview  
Front-End Engineering Design (FEED) for the Korean Polar Research Instituteâ€™s next-generation Arctic Observation Vessel.  
The project aimed to establish a robust design foundation for an advanced research icebreaker, supporting polar missions with cutting-edge laboratory facilities, reliable power systems, and compliance with international ice-class standards.

## Roles  
- Electrical System FEED Engineer  

## Scope of Work  
### 1. Concept & System Design  
- Developed one-line diagrams and preliminary load analysis for main and emergency power systems.  
- Defined electrical distribution philosophy to ensure redundancy and operability in Arctic conditions.  
- Evaluated power demands of scientific laboratories, navigation, and communication systems.  

### 2. Class & Regulatory Coordination  
- Reviewed Class requirements for ice-class vessels (redundancy, segregation, emergency power).  
- Coordinated with naval architects and mechanical engineers to ensure compliance with international standards.  
- Provided technical clarifications to vendors during FEED evaluations.  

### 3. Interdisciplinary Interface  
- Collaborated with instrumentation, telecom, and automation engineers to integrate vessel-wide systems.  
- Ensured compatibility between research equipment and power distribution network.  
- Participated in risk assessment workshops (FMEA / HAZID) to identify early-stage design risks.  

## Key Achievements  
- Delivered a reliable **power distribution concept** tailored for polar research operations.  
- Facilitated **smooth Class compliance** during the FEED phase, reducing risk of major redesign later.  
- Strengthened **interdisciplinary coordination**, enhancing overall FEED deliverable quality.
