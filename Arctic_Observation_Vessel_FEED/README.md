# ðŸ§­ KOPRI Next Generation Arctic Ice-breaking Research Vessel FEED  

## Project Overview  
Front-End Engineering Design (FEED) for the Korean Polar Research Instituteâ€™s next-generation Arctic Ice-breaking Research Vessel.  
The vessel was designed as an **Ice Class IA research ship**, equipped with advanced laboratories and robust navigation/communication systems to enable year-round polar exploration and scientific missions.

## Roles  
- Navigation & Telecom System FEED Engineer  
- Basic Design Engineer for Marine Research & Laboratory Facilities  
- Ice Class IA Compliance Coordinator  
- Technical Liaison with KOPRI  

## Scope of Work  
### 1. Navigation & Telecom System Design  
- Developed FEED-level design for navigation systems (radar, ECDIS, AIS, GMDSS, DP interface).  
- Established telecom architecture for internal/external ship communications, satellite links, and research data transfer.  
- Ensured system redundancy and integration in compliance with Ice Class IA requirements.  

### 2. Research & Laboratory Facilities Design  
- Performed basic design for onboard research laboratories and marine scientific equipment.  
- Defined power, HVAC, and data interface requirements for lab operations in extreme Arctic conditions.  
- Coordinated laboratory layouts with naval architects to maximize efficiency and operability.  

### 3. Ice Class IA Compliance  
- Applied Ice Class IA standards to electrical and telecom systems, focusing on redundancy and environmental hardening.  
- Verified compliance with Class and regulatory requirements for Arctic navigation and scientific missions.  

### 4. Client & Stakeholder Interface  
- Actively engaged with **KOPRI** through workshops, design reviews, and technical forums.  
- Presented and refined ship concept in alignment with KOPRIâ€™s operational and scientific mission requirements.  
- Facilitated interdisciplinary discussions between shipyard teams and KOPRI researchers.  

## Key Achievements  
- Delivered FEED-level **navigation & telecom system concept** tailored for Arctic research operations.  
- Defined **research laboratory basic design**, enabling integration of advanced scientific equipment.  
- Ensured **Ice Class IA compliance**, reducing design risks for Arctic operations.  
- Strengthened **client collaboration with KOPRI**, improving concept maturity and aligning design with mission goals.
