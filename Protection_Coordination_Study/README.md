### ⚡ Protection Coordination Study  
**Role:** Electric Commissioning Engineer, Electric Superintendent  

**Scope of Work:**  
- **Relay Setting & Selectivity Analysis**: Performed **protection relay coordination** for LV/MV switchboards and power distribution systems, ensuring proper time-current selectivity between upstream and downstream protective devices.  
- **Short-Circuit & Load Flow Analysis**: Verified short-circuit current levels and cable/busbar thermal limits to ensure coordination settings provided both **equipment protection** and **system reliability**.  
- **Protection Philosophy Review**: Reviewed and optimized protection schemes, including:  
  - **50/51** – Instantaneous & Time Overcurrent  
  - **50N/51N** – Earth Fault Protection  
  - **27/59** – Undervoltage / Overvoltage  
  - **87** – Differential Protection (Transformer & Busbar)  
  - **32** – Reverse Power Protection (for generator and propulsion systems)  
- **Standards Compliance**: Ensured all protection settings met **IEC 60255**, **IEC 60947-2**, **ANSI/IEEE C37** standards, and class society (ABS, DNV) requirements for marine and offshore installations.  
- **Commissioning Support**: Witnessed relay testing (**secondary injection** and trip logic verification) and validated interlocking during commissioning.  

**Key Achievements:**  
- Improved **discrimination margin** between feeder and incomer breakers, minimizing nuisance tripping and enhancing system availability.  
- Identified mis-coordinated earth fault relay settings, preventing potential blackout scenarios in vessel power systems.  
- Contributed to safe vessel and offshore platform operations by optimizing protection schemes for critical loads (navigation, telecom, and propulsion systems).
