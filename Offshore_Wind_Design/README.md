# 🌀 Offshore Wind Substation Design

This project compiles technical research and modeling activities related to offshore wind farm design, particularly focusing on feasibility studies and grid integration for the southern coast of Korea.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The work encompasses two key parts:

1. **Feasibility Study on Offshore Wind Farm in Geoje**  
   Based on climate data and policy analysis, a virtual offshore wind power plant was modeled near the Geoje coast. Tools like RETScreen were used to simulate expected energy yields and assess financial viability.  
   - Wind resource assessment (6–7 m/s)
   - Cost and ROI analysis
   - Site restrictions due to marine park boundaries
   - Policy alignment with Korea's “Renewable Energy 3020” plan

2. **Graduation Thesis: Power Transmission Systems for Offshore Wind**  
   Comparative analysis of HVAC, LCC-HVDC, and VSC-HVDC for long-distance energy transfer. This research included system-level modeling for high-efficiency, high-reliability transmission under Korean grid conditions.  
   - Grid integration strategy and system reliability review
   - Loss and cost comparison across transmission types
   - Recommendation of VSC-HVDC for offshore Korea based on technical and environmental factors

## 📘 Ongoing Research

Currently studying **DNV-ST-0145**, the offshore substation standard used in offshore wind projects, with a focus on electrical design, SCADA systems, and compliance with European offshore grid codes.
