# üåÄ Offshore Wind Substation Design

This project compiles technical research and modeling activities related to offshore wind farm design, particularly focusing on feasibility studies and grid integration for the southern coast of Korea.

## üîç Project Overview

The work encompasses four key parts:

### 1. Feasibility Study on Offshore Wind Farm in Geoje  
A virtual offshore wind power plant was modeled near the Geoje coast based on climate data and policy analysis. Tools like RETScreen were used to simulate expected energy yields and assess financial viability.

- Wind resource assessment (6‚Äì7 m/s)  
- Cost and ROI analysis  
- Site restrictions due to marine park boundaries  
- Policy alignment with Korea's ‚ÄúRenewable Energy 3020‚Äù plan

### 2. Graduation Thesis: Power Transmission Systems for Offshore Wind  
Comparative analysis of HVAC, LCC-HVDC, and VSC-HVDC systems for long-distance energy transmission. The thesis included modeling and evaluation tailored to Korean grid conditions.

- Grid integration strategy and system reliability review  
- Loss and cost comparison across transmission types  
- Recommendation of VSC-HVDC for offshore Korea based on technical and environmental factors

### 3. Field Experience with High-Voltage Transformer Systems  
Extensive field experience with high-voltage power transformers, especially for marine and offshore environments, covering the entire equipment lifecycle:

- **Factory Acceptance Testing (FAT)** at manufacturing facilities  
- **Site Acceptance Testing (SAT)** and commissioning on vessels and offshore platforms  
- **Operation and troubleshooting** involving fault diagnosis, coordination with suppliers, and on-site resolution  
- Support for safe energization and integration into offshore substations

### 4. SCADA Integration and Protection Coordination  
Practical involvement in SCADA and protection relay systems used in offshore wind and marine electrical infrastructure.

- IEC 61850-based SCADA communication design and validation  
- Configuration and testing of protection relays (OCR, DGR, Distance, Differential)  
- HMI logic verification, alarm/event matrix review, and control logic tuning  
- Exposure to cybersecurity best practices, including IEC 62443 compliance principles  
- Experience supports robust automation, fault response, and remote monitoring capabilities

## üìò Ongoing Research
